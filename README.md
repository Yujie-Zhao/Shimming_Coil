# Shimming_Coil
1D shimming coil design and optimisation algorithm

Highlights:
In the project, our primary goal was not to develop a practical compensation system but to explore the mathematical methods, electronic and digital technologies required for future customized systems in our measurement installations. Along this path, we have made significant progress:

➢Proposed a shimming coil architecture using a planar spiral coil system.

➢Tested Python algorithms for numerical optimization of functionals with a large number of variables.

➢Explored the Python symbolic calculus library SymPy, enabling complex calculations like derivatives.

➢Developed and tested a low-cost multi-channel PWM driver circuit with a current booster, facilitating the powering of numerous individual coils.

➢ Presented a scheme for testing electronic drivers using the Arduino microcontroller.

➢ Tested a USB-to-I2C adapter, allowing direct computer control of multi-channel PWM drivers without
the need for microcontrollers.

➢ Demonstrated effective heat management of electronic devices using voltage regulators and transistors.

➢ Identified potential manufacturing technologies for planar spiral coils.

➢ Successfully manufactured a working prototype of a four-channel electronic driver.
